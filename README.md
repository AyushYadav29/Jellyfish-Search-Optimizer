# Jellyfish Search (JS) (JS Chou and DN Truong, 2021)
A novel metaheuristic optimizer inspired by behavior of Jellyfish in ocean.

# Algorithm: 
The proposed optimization algorithm is based on three idealized rules:
1. Jellyfish either follow the ocean current or move inside the swarm, and a “time control mechanism” governs the switching between these types of movement.
2. Jellyfish move in the ocean in search of food. They are more attracted to locations where the available quantity of food is greater.
3. The quantity of food found is determined by the location and its corresponding objective function.
